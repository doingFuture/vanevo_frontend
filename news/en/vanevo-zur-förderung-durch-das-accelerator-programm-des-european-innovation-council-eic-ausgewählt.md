  VANEVO is really proud to announce that we are one of the selected 75
  companies that will receive funding from the EIC Accelerator! 


  The EIC Accelerator is one of Europeâ€™s flagship innovation programmes to identify, develop and scale up breakthrough technologies and game changing innovations. It is a highly competitive and selective programme. Only the most innovative companies get funded: in 2021, only 164 projects our of 4000 applications were selected (4.1 %).\

  The application includes a 3-step process and VANEVO managed to master the final step.


  In the most recent cut-off from June 2022,  1006 companies applied and 232 were invited for the last step, the interview. From these, 75 companies were selected for funding.


  With the EIC funding, VANEVO will mature its technology and reach commercial readiness.
