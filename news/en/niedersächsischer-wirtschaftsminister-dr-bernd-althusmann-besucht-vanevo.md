  We are glad to be able to welcome the minister of economics of Lower Saxony,
  Dr Bernd Althusmann, to our premises in Oldenburg. During his summer journey
  he wished to get in touch with actors of Oldenburgs's startup scene and chose
  VANEVO as the start-up he wanted to visit. During his stay VANEVO explained
  the principle of redox flow batteries, showed the latest prototype in
  operation and highlighted the necessity of storage devices for future
  decarbonized electricity systems.

  Dr Matthias Lange (energy meteo systems) as a representative of a former start-up as well as Jürgen Bath (Technologie- und Gründerzentrum) as an infrastructure provider for founders and start-ups participated in the visit and highlighted the successes of Oldenburg's start-up scene.
