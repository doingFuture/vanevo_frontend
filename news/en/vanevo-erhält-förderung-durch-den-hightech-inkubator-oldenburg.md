content: The recently founded Hightech Inkubator (HTI) Oldenburg launches its
  activities by supporting the first 10 startups/projects in the field of
  artificial intelligence (AI). VANEVO applied successfully with a project to
  develop a management system of a redox flow battery using AI. The project will
  be supported with ca. 200,000 â‚¬. We appreciate the support of the HTI and the
  state of Lower Saxony which supports the HTI! Thanks a lot!
