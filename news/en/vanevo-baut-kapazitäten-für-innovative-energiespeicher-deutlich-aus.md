content: We have secured further growth capital through a successful capital
  increase. We offer cells and modules for redox flow batteries, which are
  particularly used for storing renewable energies. VANEVO's aim is to further
  develop the market for energy storage systems in Germany, Europe and worldwide
  and to become the technology leader, particularly in storage solutions for
  commercial and industrial customers. To achieve this goal, VANEVO has
  developed a patented manufacturing process. As only one seal is required
  instead of 160, the battery cells are cheaper to produce, more energy
  efficient and easier to handle. Sales of these high tech battery cells have
  already started and test customer reactions to date have been consistently
  positive. The first deliveries to customers will take place in January 2024.
