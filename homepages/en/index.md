intro: Components from VANEVO enable storing green energy in redox flow
  batteries – at low costs and ecologically friendly!

  headline: How is VANEVO different?
  intro_content: >+
    VANEVO has developed a new assembly approach for the key component of redox
    flow batteries – the stack. VANEVO stacks need less complex parts compared
    to state of the art stacks, reducing the overall requirements. The assembly
    process is optimized for automation, allowing for fast stack manufacturing
    at low costs.

  intro_quote: "Our approach: Using adhesives instead of compressible sealings."
  outro_content: Due to the elimination of compressible sealings, massive end
    plates are no longer necessary – resulting in lighter stacks that are easier
    to handle.
  outro_quote: "The VANEVO stack: Easier, faster, cheaper."
  competitor_list:
    - Numerous, complex parts
    - Tedious assembly
    - Heavy due to massive end plates
    - High costs
  vanevo_list:
    - Less complex parts and and less parts overall
    - Quick and easy to automate
    - No massive end plates
    - Reduced costs

    In redox flow batteries, electrical energy is stored in two liquids, the
    electrolytes.\

    \

    These electrolytes are stored in tanks. The electrolytes can be charged or discharged by circulation through the stacks.\

    Redox flow batteries are non-flammable, show a high cycle life, are recyclable and offer the lowest levelized costs of storage.
  quote: "The advantage of this technology: it is safe, long-lasting, cheap and
    sustainable."
  outro_content: "By the way: redox flow batteries are a proven technology which
    has been constantly advanced over decades."

    The generation of green energy from renewable sources is not continuous but
    fluctuating.\

    When there is no wind or no sun, e.g. at night, no electricity from solar or wind can be generated.\

    For the energy transition towards renewable energies, a continuous and reliable power supply by means of electricity storage is necessary.
  quote: Redox flow batteries are perfectly suited as buffer for renewable
    electricity.
  outro_content: "Redox flow batteries can be used in various applications:"
  where_list:
    - Buffer for renewables for increased consumption by owner
    - Charging stations for electric cars
    - Peak shaving in industrial applications
    - Grid storage
    - Storage in island grids/micro grids e.g. especially in developing countries

    2015\

    During his PhD at the German Aerospace Center (DLR) Jan investigated redox flow batteries.\

    Soon he came up with the question: why is this advantageous technology not really present in the market?\

    The simple answer: it‘s too expensive!\

    Approaches and solutions to reduce costs were developed and a patent application was filed.\

    Together with 3 colleagues and funded by a project grant, the idea to cut down the costs of redox flow batteries was turned into a business idea.\

    \

    2016\

    Jannick joined the team and supported the redox flow activities within his bachelor thesis.\

    \

    2018\

    Arne, an engineer and experienced CAD designer, became part of the team. The VANEVO GmbH was founded. Purpose of the company: Development and production of components for redox flow batteries.\

    \

    2019 / 2020\

    Arne, Jannick and Jan improve the technical approaches and the business model. Another patent application for an improved production approach was filed.
  quote: "Upcoming: Grow with more employees and setting up serial production!"
